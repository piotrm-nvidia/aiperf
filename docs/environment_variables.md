# Environment Variables

AIPerf can be configured using environment variables with the `AIPERF_` prefix.
All settings are organized into logical subsystems for better discoverability.

**Pattern:** `AIPERF_{SUBSYSTEM}_{SETTING_NAME}`

**Examples:**
```bash
export AIPERF_HTTP_CONNECTION_LIMIT=5000
export AIPERF_WORKER_CPU_UTILIZATION_FACTOR=0.8
export AIPERF_ZMQ_RCVTIMEO=600000
```

> [!WARNING]
> Environment variable names, default values, and definitions are subject to change.
> These settings may be modified, renamed, or removed in future releases.
